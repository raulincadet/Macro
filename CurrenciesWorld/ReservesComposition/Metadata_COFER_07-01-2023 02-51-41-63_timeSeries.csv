"Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER)","COFER","","","","","Definition","The Currency Composition ofOfficial Foreign Exchange Reserves(COFER) database is managed by the Statistics Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The COFER website disseminates end-of-period quarterly data on COFER in the format of statistical aggregates. The currencies identified in COFER are: U.S. dollar, Pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and Euro.All other currencies are indistinguishably included in the category of “other currencies.”Prior to the introduction of Euro in 1999,several European currencieswere separately identified in COFER. COFER data are reported to the IMF on a voluntary and confidential basis. COFER data for individual countries are strictly confidential. The data published on this website are aggregates for each currency for three groupings of countries (total,advanced economies, andemerging and developing economies).",""
